          <p>
            Currently, I'm working as a full-stack developer at Via Science,
            where I build and maintain frontend apps in Angular and React,
            backend APIâ€™s and microservices with Python, Docker, Kubernetes and
            Celery, and deployment pipelines with tools like Terraform, and AWS.
            I am passionate about building software and tools that people can
            use to make the world a better place, and Viaâ€™s mission of building
            software that can make communities cleaner, safer, and more
            equitable perfectly aligns with that passion.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work philosophy is rooted in collaboration and communication. I
            believe that the best results come from working with a team that is
            open and transparent about their goals, challenges, and ideas. I
            strive to approach each project with a problem-solving mindset,
            focusing on identifying the root cause of any issues and developing
            elegant, scalable solutions. Additionally, I value continuous
            learning and growth, and I'm always looking for ways to expand my
            skill set and stay up to date with the latest trends and
            technologies in the industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got into tech because I wanted to move into a career where I could
            have more impact in what I was doing and more agency over my own
            growth. What I love about this industry is that it encourages and
            demands constant learning. As someone who loves to discover new
            concepts, practice new skills and take on new challenges, I cannot
            imagine a more perfect space to exist in. I have always enjoyed
            using technology, and I absolutely love that I get to work in this
            space where I get to deliver products that others can find the same
            joy in that I felt growing up with technology.
