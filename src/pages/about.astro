          Currently, I'm working as a full-stack developer at Via Science, where
          I build and maintain frontend apps in Angular and React, backend APIâ€™s
          and microservices with Python, Docker, Kubernetes and Celery, and
          deployment pipelines with tools like Terraform, and AWS. I am
          passionate about building software and tools that people can use to
          make the world a better place, and Viaâ€™s mission of moving the needle
          toward cleaner, safer, and more equitable communities perfectly aligns
          with that passion.

        <!-- <p class="">
          Prior to my current position, I worked briefly as a freelance developer
          and took on projects using React helping a budding startup put together
          a component library for internal use, and React Native and Expo building
          out an MVP mobile app for a trucking company to help automate
          dispatching and check-in workflows.
        </p> -->

          I got into tech because I wanted to shift into a career where I could
          have more impact in what I was doing and more agency over my own
          growth. What I love about this industry is that it encourages and
          demands constant learning. As someone who loves to discover new
          concepts, practice new skills and take on new challenges, I cannot
          imagine a more perfect space to exist in. I have always enjoyed using
          technology, and I absolutely love that I get to work in this space
          where I get to deliver products that others can find the same joy in
          that I felt growing up with technology.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          My work philosophy is rooted in collaboration and communication. I
          believe that the best results come from working with a team that is
          open and transparent about their goals, challenges, and ideas. I
          strive to approach each project with a problem-solving mindset,
          focusing on identifying the root cause of any issues and developing
          elegant, scalable solutions. Additionally, I value continuous learning
          and growth, and I'm always looking for ways to expand my skill set and
          stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the
          industry.
