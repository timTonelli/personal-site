            I'm currently working at a startup based out of Somverille, MA. When
            I am not writing code, I enjoy playing video games, tinkering with
            mechanical keyboards, and spending time with my partner, Clare.

            I have always been a naturally curious person. For as long as I can
            remember I have always tried to piece together how things work and
            why they were made the way they were.

            During the pandemic I fell deep into the rabbit-hole of building
            mechanical keyboards, and since then I have built quite a few. My
            current board of choice is a Suave Blue KFE CE with Penyu switches
            with GMK Noire keycaps. I have really enjoyed this hobby as a way to
            scratch my itch to tinker every now and again, and it's a nice way
            to make the mundane act of typing a more enjoyable experience.

            Video games are my go-to when I want to unwind. Some of my favorites
            are Destiny 2 and the Horizon series. Up next on my list of games to
            play are the recent God of War games, and I am eagerly awaiting the
            release of Diablo 4.
