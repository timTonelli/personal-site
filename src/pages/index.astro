          <p>
            As a developer, one of my main drives is to have a positive impact
            on people's lives through the software I build. I'm currently
            working at VIA, providing data-driven solutions that work toward
            making communities cleaner, safer and more equitable. I value
            continuous learning and growth, and I'm always looking for ways to
            expand my skill set and stay up to date with the latest trends and
            technologies in the industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not writing code, I enjoy playing video games, tinkering
            with mechanical keyboards, and spending time with my partner Clare.
